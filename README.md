# MusicTheme-Bot
This is a Discord Bot that plays music and stays awake 24/7 using UpTimeRobot. This bot is activated using **repl.it** <br />
**update:** unfortunately, UpTimeRobot have ended their support for repl.it projects and therefore the bot will not remain awake for 24/7 any longer :(
## Where are the integral parts of the code at?
### music.py

### main.py
- Activates the bot. <br />
### keep_alive.py
